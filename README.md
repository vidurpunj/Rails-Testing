Capybara helps you test web applications by simulating how a real user would interact with your app.

# Rspec: BDD its parent TDD
Behaviour Driven Development for Ruby.
Behavior-driven development is an idea built on top of TDD.
Rails tests operate at a “low level”, meaning no browser interaction is involved.
Low-level tests can be executed with just RSpec
Capybara provides helper methods like fill_in to fill in a form field, click_on to click a button, etc.

# Cucumber:
Cucumber is a tool for writing test cases in something close to English.
Cucumber can be connected with RSpec and Capybara and used to write integration tests.
Cucumber adds both a layer of mental overhead and a layer of maintenance overhead on top of the RSpec + Capybara combination.
